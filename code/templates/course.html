                        <p> Posted on: Tuesday, 5 October 2021 8:48:50 AM AEST</p>
                        <p> Hi Teams,</p>
                        <p> This Thursday we have a guest lecture starting promptly at 5pm (Brisbane) *NOTE the unusual time*. The guest speaker is Prof Caroline Jay, Head of Research in the School of Engineering at The University of Manchester (UK). Prof. Jay will be speaking about the future of Human Centred Design. The details for this guest lecture are below. I'd like to ask you all to keep chat in the Zoom meeting to only questions for the guest speaker and remind everyone to be polite. It is overwhelming and impolite to the speaker to see banter going on in the Zoom chat. Please keep any course or assessment questions to MS Teams only. If you feel a strong need to engage in banter during the guest lecture then please use the social channel in MS Teams instead.
                        Guest speakers on this course are giving up their time to speak with you, I encourage you to approach this with a positive attitude.</p>
                        <p> Speaker: Prof Caroline Jay</p>
                        <p> Date: Thursday 7th October</p>
                        <p> Time: 5pm</p>
                        <p> Zoom Link: https://uqz.zoom.us/j/85034600579</p>
                        <p> Bio:
                        Caroline Jay is a Professor of Computer Science and joint Head of Research in the School of 
                        Engineering. She is qualified as both a Psychologist (BA, CPsychol) and Computer Scientist 
                        (MSc, PhD), and undertakes research crossing these domains. She is Research Director of the 
                        Software Sustainabilty Institute, and a keen advocate for open and reproducible science. Caroline is a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute,
                         where she leads the 'Human-Centred Systems' health project. She leads the Manchester arm of the BBC Data Science Research Partnership, and the Human-Centred Design theme of the 'Digital Futures' initiative.</p>
                        <p> Week 10 Tasks: 
                        Hold your sprint review and retrospective
                        Plan your next sprint
                        Arrange your sprint review for next week with your zone tutor
                        Arrange your individual review times with your zone tutor for next week
                        Review your usability testing/evaluation plan to ensure it is on track
                        For on campus students - if you want to do a museum tour then sign up 4:30-5:15 session which has some available slots (I know this conflicts with the guest lecture but on this occasion this clash is unavoidable)
                        Check your understanding with the Week 10 Quiz</p>

                                This link is to the recording of the guest lecture by Jason Weigel on Team Dynamics. The purpose of this lecture is to encourage you to learn about the diffrent stages in team behaviour across the duration of a project. Being able to recognise these stages is important to understanding how to leverage them in your teamwork activities to maximise productive work. For example during the storming stage, people in the team may try to push against established boundaries potentially giving rise to friction. If you can recognise this is happening, you can avoid this friction developing into serious disageements that damage your ability to work as a team.
