                        <p> Hi Teams,</p>
                        <p> This Thursday we have a guest lecture starting promptly at 5pm (Brisbane) *NOTE the unusual time*. The guest speaker is Prof Caroline Jay, Head of Research in the School of Engineering at The University of Manchester (UK). Prof. Jay will be speaking about the future of Human Centred Design. The details for this guest lecture are below. I'd like to ask you all to keep chat in the Zoom meeting to only questions for the guest speaker and remind everyone to be polite. It is overwhelming and impolite to the speaker to see banter going on in the Zoom chat. Please keep any course or assessment questions to MS Teams only. If you feel a strong need to engage in banter during the guest lecture then please use the social channel in MS Teams instead.
                        Guest speakers on this course are giving up their time to speak with you, I encourage you to approach this with a positive attitude.</p>
                        <p> Speaker: Prof Caroline Jay</p>

                        <p> Week 10 Tasks: 
                        Hold your sprint review and retrospective
                        Plan your next sprint
                        Arrange your sprint review for next week with your zone tutor
                        Arrange your individual review times with your zone tutor for next week
                        Review your usability testing/evaluation plan to ensure it is on track
                        For on campus students - if you want to do a museum tour then sign up 4:30-5:15 session which has some available slots (I know this conflicts with the guest lecture but on this occasion this clash is unavoidable)
                        Check your understanding with the Week 10 Quiz</p>

                        <p>Week 10</p>
                        <p>Posted on: Monday, 4 October 2021 4:39:04 PM AEST</p>
                        <p>Hi everyone,

                        Welcome back after the break! 

                        The tutorial this week is on amortised analysis, that we covered before the break in week 9. In lectures we'll be starting to talk about complexity classes P and NP, and why there are interesting and relevant to programmers. 

                        We also have Quiz 5 due on Friday -- so don't forget about that!

                        Assignment 2 is now available as well. It's a Dynamic Programming assignment, so before you start, make sure that you've covered all of the Dynamic Programming lecture material, and the related tutorial, tutorial 6 from week 8. This week I recommend that you

                        read through the problem and familiarise yourself with it, and then
                        start work on Q1(a). 
                        For Q1(a) you need to implement a naive recursive solution that identifies the optimal substructure of the problem that you will be using in Q1(c).

                        This is like the first step we took in lectures, when we came up with a dynamic programming solution to, for example, the longest-common subsequence problem. (We did the same think for the other examples we looked through as well).

                        Finding a recurrence that identifies the optimal substructure of your problem is the hard part. Once you have that, converting it to a bottom-up dynamic programming solution should be fairly straightforward -- you just need to create a table to store the solutions to your subproblems, and then fill them in methodically, starting from the base cases, in a way that respects the subproblem dependencies that you identified in your recurrence.

                        The recurrence corresponding to your implementation from Q1(a) should identify a number of subproblems that is polynomial in n (the number of cars), m (the number of ferries), and C (the maximum length of any of the m ferries). If it doesn't have that, then it means that you haven't properly identified the sub-problems, their dependencies and relationships, in a way that can be converted to an efficient dynamic programming solution. You also need that each of the subproblems that you identify can be calculated from the solutions to the subproblems that it depends on in time that is polynomial (in n, m and C).

                        To come up with an efficient dynamic programming solution you have to do that first! That is, you have to identify what your subproblems are, and what the relationship between them is. That's what Q1(a) is asking for.

                        The tutorials in week 11 (next week) will run as drop-in sessions where you can come to ask questions and get help with the second assignment.
                        </p>
                        <p>Best for now,
                        Larissa</p>

                        <p>PS: Plagiarism/Collusion: Assignment 2 is individual, which means that you should be completing it yourself -- 
                            not working it out as a collective group, copying your solution from someone else, 
                            sharing your solution with someone else etc.  In general the assignment tasks are designed to give you chance
                             to practice your problem solving skills and learn the course material better, so please take the chance to do 
                             that! Following UQ procedures, we are required to use sophisticated software to check submissions for possible
                              collusion/plagiarism, and to refer any suspected cases to the School's Integrity Officer for official investigation.

                        <p>Posted on: Monday, 4 October 2021 9:40:26 PM AEST</p>
                        <p>Good evening COMP3702 students,

                        I have uploaded this week's tutorial (Tutorial 9) on Multi-Armed Bandits and Reinforcement Learning to Blackboard.

                        The last part of the tutorial involves implementing Q-learning in the grid world that we saw in Tutorial 7. This may take up more time to solve than is provided in the tutorial, so please attempt to complete this on your own before/after the tutorials. The tutors will go through the solution in more detail next week.

                        For those who missed their tutorial today due to the public holiday, you are welcome to attend the other sessions online (or in person, subject to space).
                        </p>
                        <p>Kind regards,
