                        Hi everyone,
                        Welcome back after the break! 
                        The tutorial this week is on amortised analysis, that we covered before the break in week 9. In lectures we'll be starting to talk about complexity classes P and NP, and why there are interesting and relevant to programmers. 
                        We also have Quiz 5 due on Friday ...
